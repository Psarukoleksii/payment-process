# Solution Overview
To handle multiple payment processing providers in a flexible and maintainable way within a NestJS application, I recommend using the `Strategy Pattern`. 
This pattern is ideal because it allows the application to switch between different algorithms (in this case, payment processors) dynamically. It encapsulates each algorithm, making the system easier to extend and maintain.


## Design Implementation
Hereâ€™s how we can implement this:

`PaymentService Interface`: This will define the common operations available to all payment services.

`Concrete Payment Services`: Separate classes for Stripe, Braintree, and PayPal that implement the PaymentService interface.

`PaymentServiceFactory`: A factory class to create instances of payment services based on the customer's choice.

`OrderService`: This service will use the PaymentServiceFactory to handle the payment processing without needing to know the details of the specific payment provider.
